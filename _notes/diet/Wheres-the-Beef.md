**Podcast**: [The Way I Heard It](https://mikerowe.com/podcast/) | **Guest**: Vinnie Tortorich

**Guest Details:**
- Vinnie Tortorich, a fitness trainer, author, cancer survivor, and filmmaker.

**Key Discussion Points:**

- **Introduction to Vinnie:**
  - Vinnie Tortorich is introduced as a multifaceted individual with a career spanning fitness training, authorship, and filmmaking. His most recent documentary, "Beyond Impossible," critiques the fake meat industry.

- **Vinnie's Health Philosophy:**
  - He advocates for a diet devoid of sugars and grains, promoting a lifestyle centered around fresh meat and vegetables. This approach, which he labels as NSNG (No Sugar, No Grains), has roots in his own health journey, particularly after surviving leukemia in 2007.

- **Career Beginnings:**
  - Vinnie shares how he gained fame in Hollywood by helping comedian Margaret Cho lose significant weight, which launched his career as a trainer and diet advocate.

- **The Evolution of Diet Culture:**
  - Tortorich traces the historical push towards grain-based diets and the vilification of meat back to figures like Ellen G. White and Ancel Keys. He criticizes the dietary guidelines stemming from these influences, particularly the U.S. food pyramid.

- **Health and Weight Loss:**
  - Vinnie explains that weight loss isn't primarily about calories in vs. calories out but about hormonal responses. He discusses how insulin, ghrelin, and leptin interact to affect hunger and fat storage, emphasizing that exercise alone won't solve weight issues without dietary changes.

- **Dietary Advice:**
  - For those looking to lose weight or maintain health, Vinnie recommends:
    - Avoiding processed foods, seed oils, and high sugar content.
    - Eating high-fat cheeses, pork rinds, and specific nuts like macadamia, walnuts, and pecans.
    - Incorporating berries for sweet cravings but pairing them with fats.
    - Steering clear of processed meats unless from a trusted butcher.

- **Exercise:**
  - While exercise isn't seen as the primary method for weight loss, Vinnie underscores its importance for overall health, particularly in preventing muscle loss (sarcopenia) as one ages. He advocates for daily walking, which he and Mike practice, achieving thousands of steps daily.

- **Personal Anecdotes and Challenges:**
  - Vinnie shares his experience with cancer and how adopting his NSNG lifestyle has kept him cancer-free post-remission. He also talks about the backlash he's received for his views, including being shadow-banned on social media platforms and having his Wikipedia page removed.

- **Public Perception and Media:**
  - He expresses frustration with misinformation and the dietary advice that leads to obesity, highlighting how his documentaries aim to educate through storytelling and evidence.

- **Lifestyle Recommendations:**
  - The conversation concludes with advice to surround oneself with healthy food options to promote better eating habits and to integrate daily physical activities like walking into one's routine for health benefits.

**Conclusion:**
- Vinnie Tortorich's approach is about returning to natural, unprocessed foods, understanding the hormonal aspects of food intake, and using exercise for health rather than just weight loss. His personal journey and public advocacy aim at debunking myths and challenging mainstream dietary habits.
