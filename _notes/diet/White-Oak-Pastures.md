## [Joe Rogan Experience #1893 - Will Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozNK2sgJmcg)

**Podcast**: [The Joe Rogan Experience](https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk) | **Guest**: Will Harris

**Guest Details:**
- Will Harris, fourth-generation farmer of White Oak Pastures.

**Key Discussion Points:**

- **Introduction to Will Harris:**
  - Will Harris is the fourth generation of his family to manage White Oak Pastures, a farm established in 1866. His farm now employs 180 people, significantly impacting the local economy of Bluffton, Georgia.

- **Transition from Industrial to Regenerative Farming:**
  - Harris discusses his shift from industrial farming practices, which he learned at the University of Georgia, to regenerative agriculture. This change was motivated by recognizing the unintended negative consequences of industrial methods on animal welfare, soil health, and the environment.

- **Regenerative Agriculture Practices:**
  - **Animal Welfare:** Harris moved from seeing animals as mere production units to providing environments where they can express natural behaviors, which he believes is integral to animal welfare.
  - **Soil Health:** He criticizes the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and cultivation techniques, which degrade soil health by oxidizing carbon and killing beneficial microbes.
  - **Biodiversity and Carbon Sequestration:** His farm practices biomimicry, aiming to emulate natural cycles, enhancing biodiversity, and sequestering carbon through grazing practices.

- **Challenges and Critiques:**
  - **Scalability vs. Replicability:** Harris argues his methods are highly replicable but not scalable in the traditional sense, suggesting a farm like his could exist in every agricultural county but not as large corporations.
  - **Economic and Cultural Barriers:** He explains why other farmers might resist change due to investment in current systems, cultural practices, and the influence of industry and government policies.

- **Environmental Impact:**
  - **Water Quality:** A visual demonstration of water runoff from his farm versus a neighbor's industrial farm shows the stark contrast in environmental impact, with his farm's runoff being clear due to better soil structure and less chemical use.
  - **Carbon Footprint:** Harris claims his farm sequesters more carbon than it emits, making it a net positive for the environment, countering narratives that all cattle farming contributes to environmental degradation.

- **Critique of Big Ag and Tech in Agriculture:**
  - Harris is skeptical of technological solutions like carbon capture machines, advocating for natural systems to manage carbon cycles. He also expresses concern over technocrats like Bill Gates owning large swathes of farmland due to potential misuse of technology in agriculture.

- **Consumer Impact and Education:**
  - He believes consumer demand could drive change in agriculture practices. However, he notes the challenge in educating consumers about the benefits of regenerative farming over industrial methods.

- **Whole Foods Market and Greenwashing:**
  - Harris criticizes Whole Foods for what he perceives as greenwashing, particularly with their meat rating system, which he feels misleads consumers about the true welfare and environmental impact of their products.

- **Local and Direct Sales:**
  - He prefers selling directly to consumers or through local chains like Publix, which he feels value his product more genuinely than larger corporations like Whole Foods.

- **Future Outlook:**
  - Harris is hopeful about initiatives like solar grazing, where his livestock manage vegetation under solar panels, combining renewable energy with regenerative farming practices.

- **Books and Further Engagement:**
  - A book titled "A Bold Return to Giving a Damn" about his experiences and philosophies is set to be published by Penguin Viking Random House.

**Conclusion:**
- Will Harris provides a compelling argument for why regenerative agriculture could be a sustainable future for farming, emphasizing the need for consumers to understand and support these practices for broader adoption. His commitment to education and local economic revitalization through farming is a central theme of his work.
