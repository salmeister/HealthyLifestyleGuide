### What is NSNG?
NSNG stands for No Sugar, No Grains, a lifestyle aimed at reducing carbohydrate intake to improve health and weight management. Key benefits include stabilized energy levels, improved symptoms of metabolic syndrome, and enhanced physical performance.

### Debunking Food Myths:
Nutritional myths such as "calorie in/calorie out," the necessity of veganism for health, and the benefits of whole grains and low-fat products are challenged. NSNG advocates for a diet free from these often misleading concepts.

### The Science Behind NSNG:
NSNG leads to weight loss primarily through the reduction of insulin and glucose spikes, fostering hormonal balance and appetite control. Emerging research supports the health benefits of reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat consumption.

### Getting Started:
1. **Preparation**: Remove all products containing sugar, grains, low-fat, non-fat options, diet products, and artificial sweeteners from your pantry, fridge, and freezer.
2. **Avoid**: All forms of sugar, commonly used grains (wheat, corn, rice, etc.), processed foods containing these ingredients.
3. **Beverages**: Consume water, unsweetened coffee and tea, broth, and avoid diet sodas and sugary drinks.

### What Can You Eat?
NSNG encourages consuming:
- **Proteins**: Eggs, bacon, beef, chicken, lamb, pork, fish, seafood.
- **Dairy**: Cheese, full-fat plain yogurt, cottage cheese, heavy whipping cream, creme fraiche.
- **Fats**: Butter, olives, avocado, various oils including coconut oil and macadamia nut oil.
- **Vegetables**: All except starchy vegetables (avoid potatoes and corn).
- **Fruits**: Berries and cherries in moderation.
- **Nuts and Seeds**: Raw nuts, avoiding those with added sugars or artificial flavors.

### Exercise Philosophy:
Exercise enhances fitness and muscle quality but should not be viewed as the primary method for weight loss. Weight-bearing exercises, aerobic activity, resistance training, and stretching are recommended.

### Initial Adaptation:
Newcomers may experience "keto flu" (discomfort while transitioning to low-carb intake) that typically lasts 12-36 hours. Staying hydrated and consuming appropriate NSNG snacks can help mitigate symptoms.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):
Covered topics include the basics of NSNG, the difference between NSNG and gluten-free diets, types of acceptable sugars and fats, the importance of reading labels, and long-term strategies for maintaining the lifestyle.

### Resources:
The eBook provides books and studies supporting the principles of NSNG are recommended, along with sources for high-quality food products and consultation services for personalized guidance.
