## [Fat: A Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVJM_0XEiBI)

**Overview:**
- **Director/Host:** Vinnie Tortorich
- **Focus:** The documentary examines the myths and misconceptions about health, diet, and nutrition in the United States, particularly critiquing the dietary guidelines and the war on fat.

**Key Points:**

- **Charlie's Story:**
  - The documentary begins with the story of Charlie Abrahams, who suffered from severe epilepsy. Despite trying numerous drugs and undergoing brain surgery, his seizures continued until his father, Jim Abrahams, discovered the ketogenic diet, which dramatically improved Charlie's condition. This narrative underscores the neglect of dietary interventions by the medical community.

- **Health Myths:**
  - **Grains and Fat:** Tortorich challenges the idea that grains are healthy and fats are harmful, tracing these myths back to historical dietary advice influenced by figures like Ellen White from the Seventh-day Adventist Church, who advocated for vegetarianism due to religious visions rather than scientific evidence.
  - **Calorie in, Calorie out:** The documentary criticizes the oversimplified approach to weight loss, emphasizing that hormonal responses to food types (like insulin from carbohydrates) play a significant role beyond mere caloric intake.

- **Historical Context:**
  - **Seventh-day Adventists:** The influence of Ellen White's visions on modern dietary practices, particularly vegetarianism and the creation of Cornflakes by John Kellogg to curb sexual desires.
  - **Vilhjalmur Stefansson:** His experience living with Inuits and adopting their high-fat, meat-based diet, which contradicted contemporary Western dietary beliefs.

- **The Diet Heart Hypothesis:**
  - Introduced by Ancel Keys, this hypothesis linked saturated fat and cholesterol intake to heart disease. The documentary highlights the selective use of data in the Seven Countries Study to support this idea, despite broader evidence showing no direct causation.

- **The McGovern Committee:**
  - This Senate committee, initially aimed at addressing hunger, inadvertently shaped dietary guidelines that pushed for low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets, coinciding with rising obesity rates in the U.S.

- **Medical and Scientific Critique:**
  - **Cholesterol and Statins:** The narrative discusses the shift in medical advice from managing cholesterol to using statins, questioning the effectiveness and necessity of these drugs based on flawed dietary advice.
  - **Lack of Nutritional Education:** The documentary notes that medical schools often provide insufficient education on nutrition, leading doctors to overlook dietary interventions.

- **Ketogenic Diet:**
  - The film advocates for the ketogenic diet, not just for epilepsy but as a potential approach for various health issues, including diabetes and obesity, by promoting fat as a primary energy source.

- **Industry Influence:**
  - Accusations of suppression of dietary research due to conflicts of interest with the food, pharmaceutical, and medical device industries, which benefit from the status quo of dietary recommendations.

- **Personal Stories and Expert Opinions:**
  - Includes testimonials from individuals like the McKenzie family, who managed Type 1 diabetes through diet, and expert commentary from figures like Gary Taubes and Nina Teicholz, who have written on similar topics.

- **Call to Action:**
  - Tortorich urges viewers to take personal responsibility for their health by questioning mainstream dietary advice and experimenting with diets like keto to see personal health benefits.

**Conclusion:**
- The documentary ends with a plea for a return to natural foods, highlighting the need for a cultural shift away from processed foods, sugars, and grains, towards diets that are more in line with human physiology as understood through less biased, historical, and modern research.
