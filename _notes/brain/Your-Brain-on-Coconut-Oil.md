#### **Introduction**
- **Host**: Vinnie Tortorich
- **Guest**: Dr. Mary Newport, a neonatologist known for her work with ketogenic diets and Alzheimer's disease.

#### **Dr. Newport's Background and Story**
- **Career**: Spent 30 years in newborn intensive care.
- **Husband's Health**: Her husband, Steve, developed early-onset Alzheimer's at 51. His initial symptoms were memory lapses, progressing to severe cognitive and physical decline.

#### **Discovery of Ketones**
- **Turning Point**: After Steve failed to qualify for a clinical trial due to low cognitive scores, Dr. Newport discovered a study linking medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) from coconut oil with cognitive improvement in Alzheimer's patients.
- **Implementation**: She introduced coconut oil into Steve's diet, seeing dramatic improvements in his cognitive function in just days, including mood, physical coordination, and memory.

#### **Ketogenic Diet and Alzheimer's**
- **Mechanism**: Explained Alzheimer's as a type of "diabetes of the brain" where glucose metabolism is impaired, and ketones can provide an alternative fuel source.
- **Steve's Experience**: 
  - **Before**: Could not draw a simple clock, indicative of severe cognitive impairment.
  - **After**: Showed significant improvement in clock drawing and overall cognitive function after starting coconut oil.

#### **Research and Advocacy**
- **Further Studies**: Discussed ongoing research on ketogenic diets, including work by Dominic D'Agostino and Stephen Cunnane, focusing on ketone salts and esters.
- **Benefits**: Noted potential benefits of ketones for other conditions like epilepsy, cancer, heart, and kidney diseases.

#### **Practical Advice**
- **Coconut Oil**: Advocated for using unrefined organic coconut oil over MCT oil due to additional health benefits.
- **Ketone Supplements**: Mentioned brands like Pr√ºvit, Real Ketones, and KetoStart for ketone salts, and KetoneAid for esters, but emphasized starting with natural sources like coconut oil.

#### **Dr. Newport's Book**
- **Title**: "Clearly Keto for Healthy Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Prevention"
- **Content**: Covers the ketogenic diet's role in brain health, with chapters on insulin resistance, brain energy gaps, and other lifestyle factors influencing cognitive health.

#### **Personal Impact and Loss**
- **Steve's Later Life**: Despite initial improvements, Steve suffered a severe seizure due to an unrelated incident, leading to further deterioration and eventual death in 2016 from Alzheimer's.
- **Reflections**: Dr. Newport shared how these experiences led her to hospice work, where she continued helping others with dementia.

#### **Closing Remarks**
- **Advocacy**: Encourages exploring ketogenic strategies for health maintenance or disease management, emphasizing the need for more research and acceptance in the medical community.
- **Consultation**: Vinnie mentions his consultation services for those interested in diet and health.

This episode highlights Dr. Newport's journey from a personal health crisis to becoming a proponent of ketogenic diets for neurodegenerative diseases, offering both personal anecdotes and scientific insights.
