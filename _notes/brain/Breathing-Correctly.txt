## [Breathing Correctly with James Nestor - Episode 2046](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OKoZLS-h5g)

**Podcast**: [Fitness Confidential Podcast](https://vinnietortorich.com/) | **Guest**: James Nestor

#### **Introduction**
- **Host**: Vinnie Tortorich
- **Guest**: James Nestor, author of books like "Breathe," "Deep," and "Get High Now (Without Drugs)," discussing breathing techniques, health, and physiology.

#### **James Nestor's Background and Work**
- **Writing**: Nestor writes for publications like Outside, Scientific American, and has written books on topics like freediving and breathing for health.
- **Approach**: Describes his method as similar to George Plimpton, immersing himself in subjects to write about them effectively.

#### **Breathing and Health**
- **Wim Hof**: Discusses the impact of breathing practices like those popularized by Wim Hof, involving cold exposure and breath control for health benefits.
- **Breathing Techniques**:
  - **Mouth vs. Nose Breathing**: Mouth breathing can lead to lower carbon dioxide levels, reducing circulation and causing cold extremities. Nasal breathing helps maintain optimal CO2 levels.
  - **Nasal Cycle**: Explains how nostrils alternate in dominance, affecting heart rate and circulation, and how this can impact breathing during exercise or rest.
- **Physical Development**: Talks about how historical changes in diet and lifestyle have led to smaller jaw sizes, resulting in crowded teeth and narrower airways, exacerbating breathing issues.

#### **COVID-19 Anecdotes**
- **Personal Experiences**: Both Vinnie and James share personal stories about their encounters with COVID-19, highlighting the unpredictable nature of the virus's spread.

#### **Inspiratory Muscle Training**
- **Arrow Fit and Similar Devices**: Discusses inspiratory muscle trainers like Arrow Fit, which aim to increase lung capacity and efficiency. 
  - **Efficacy**: These devices, based on research by Dr. Allison McConnell, can enhance athletic performance, lower blood pressure, and even help with conditions like sleep apnea through regular use.
  - **Cost and Accessibility**: Nestor points out more affordable alternatives to Arrow Fit, like a $15 analog version on Amazon, advocating for consistency in practice for benefits.

#### **Breathing for Health and Performance**
- **Breathing Rates**: Normalizes the idea that individual breathing rates can vary based on body size, lung capacity, and other factors. Suggests that a resting rate of around six breaths per minute can be beneficial for some but not universally optimal.
- **Resting Heart Rate**: Links low resting heart rate to health benefits, including longevity.

#### **Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **Products**: Encourages listeners to explore inspiratory muscle trainers but to start with more affordable options.
- **Support**: Vinnie promotes supporting the podcast through his website before buying from Amazon, and mentions his Super Fan page akin to PBS funding.

This episode dives into the science of breathing, its impact on health, and the practical applications of specific breathing techniques and tools for enhancing physical well-being.
