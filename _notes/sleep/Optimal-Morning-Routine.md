## Overview

**üéß Source**: [After Skool](https://www.youtube.com/@AfterSkool) YouTube | **üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Expert**: Dr. Andrew Huberman  
**üéØ Topic**: Science-Based Morning Optimization  
**‚è±Ô∏è Key Takeaway**: Foundational morning behaviors can dramatically impact alertness, focus, and overall daily performance

#### **Foundational Behaviors for Daily Optimization**

- **Sleep and Non-Sleep Deep Rest**: 
  - **Sleep**: Essential for regulating metabolism, immune system, and cognitive functions. Aim for good sleep 80% of the time.
  - **Non-Sleep Deep Rest**: Helps in daily performance even when sleep isn't perfect.

#### **Circadian Rhythms and Light Exposure**

- **Circadian Clocks**: 
  - Every cell has a 24-hour cycle; aligning these clocks is crucial for health.
  - **Morning Light Exposure**: 
    - Get natural light in your eyes within an hour of waking to anchor the cortisol pulse, set temperature rhythms, alertness, and mood.
    - Ideal is 5-10 minutes of outdoor light without sunglasses, even on cloudy days.
    - Indoor lights are not sufficient; use LED light boxes if natural light isn't available.

- **Effects of Light**:
  - Light exposure triggers dopamine release, influencing motivation, mood, and even physical changes in skin and fur in animals (seasonal breeding).
  - Light on skin increases testosterone and estrogen, potentially enhancing passion and drive.

#### **Caffeine and Adenosine**

- **Adenosine Build-Up**: 
  - Accumulates during wakefulness, promoting sleepiness through the parasympathetic nervous system.
  - **Caffeine**: Blocks adenosine, enhancing alertness but can lead to an afternoon crash if consumed too early.

- **Practical Advice**: 
  - Delay caffeine intake by 60-90 minutes after waking to clear adenosine naturally.
  - Exercise can also help clear adenosine, improving alertness.

#### **Temperature and Body Rhythms**

- **Core Body Temperature**: 
  - Waking up coincides with a rise in core body temperature, which triggers cortisol release.
  - **Temperature Minimum**: Typically around 2-3 hours before waking, crucial for understanding sleep cycles.

- **Temperature Regulation for Sleep**: 
  - Keep rooms cool at night to facilitate sleep by lowering core temperature.

#### **Cold Exposure**

- **Benefits of Cold Exposure**: 
  - Increases core body temperature paradoxically, leading to a release of epinephrine and dopamine.
  - Can mimic some effects of addictive substances in terms of dopamine release, potentially aiding in addiction recovery.
  - Helps in creating a sense of summer within the body, enhancing mood and physical performance.

#### **Conclusion**

- **Morning Routine**: 
  - Bright light exposure, delaying caffeine, exercise, and possibly cold exposure can significantly enhance daily performance, mood, and health.

- **Resources**: 
  - Huberman Lab podcast for further tools on mental, physical health, and performance.
  - Social media and the official website for additional content and information.
