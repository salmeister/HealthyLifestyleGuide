## Overview

**üìö Resource**: [Huberman Lab Toolkit](https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/toolkit-for-sleep) | **üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Expert**: Dr. Andrew Huberman  
**üéØ Topic**: Science-Based Sleep Optimization  
**‚è±Ô∏è Key Takeaway**: 12 actionable steps based on neuroscience research to dramatically improve sleep quality and duration

### 1. Morning and Afternoon Sunlight
- **Morning**: View sunlight within 30-60 minutes of waking. 
- **Afternoon**: View sunlight prior to sunset. 
- **Cloud Conditions**: 10 min on bright days, 20 min on cloudy days, 30-60 min on overcast days.
- **Without Sunglasses**: No brimmed hats or staying in shade.

### 2. Consistent Wake and Sleep Times
- **Consistency**: Wake up at the same time daily.
- **Sleeping**: Go to sleep when first feeling sleepy to avoid late-night wakefulness issues.

### 3. Caffeine Cutoff
- **Avoid Caffeine**: Should not be consumed 8-10 hours before bedtime (12-14 hours recommended by sleep experts).

### 4. Use the Reveri App
- **For Sleep Disturbances**: Utilize sleep self-hypnosis protocols 3 times a week. 

### 5. Avoid Bright Lights at Night
- **Minimal Light**: Use only necessary artificial light between 10 pm and 4 am. Prefer candlelight or moonlight.

### 6. Limit Naps
- **Nap Length**: Keep naps under 90 minutes. Ideal length: 30-45 minutes.

### 7. Middle-of-the-Night Wakefulness
- **NSDR Protocols**: Use Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) or Yoga Nidra from YouTube to help fall back asleep.

### 8. Sleep Supplements (Optional)
- **Magnesium**: 145mg Threonate or 200mg Bisglycinate
- **Apigenin**: 50mg
- **Theanine**: 100-400mg
- **Glycine**: 2g (3-4 nights per week)
- **GABA**: 100mg (3-4 nights per week)
- **Note**: Introduce supplements gradually and monitor effects.

### 9. Pre-Bedtime Alertness
- **Normal Spike**: Expect a natural spike in wakefulness an hour before bedtime.

### 10. Cool, Dark Sleeping Environment
- **Temperature**: Ensure your sleeping environment is cool. Layer blankets that can be removed to regulate temperature.

### 11. Avoid Alcohol and Sleep Medications
- **Disruptive Effects**: Both can interfere with quality sleep.

### 12. Adapt Sleep Needs Over Time
- **Changing Needs**: Sleep requirements may evolve with age and season.

## Conclusion
Prioritize and master your sleep habits to enhance overall health and performance. Occasional deviations are natural, but long-term consistency is key.
