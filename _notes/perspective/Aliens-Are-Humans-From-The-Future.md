#### **Introduction**
- **Host**: Jesse Michels
- **Guest**: Dr. Michael P. Masters, biological anthropologist and professor at Montana Tech University
- **Books**: *Identified Flying Objects*, *The Extra-Tempesto Model*, and *Revelation: The Future Human Past*
- **Central Thesis**: UFO occupants aren't aliens from another planet—they're humans from the future who've mastered time travel and are visiting their own evolutionary past

#### **The Evolutionary Evidence**

**Morphological Convergence**
- **The FREE Study**: Dr. Edgar Mitchell's study of 3,500+ contactees/abductees (now 5,000+)
- **Key Finding**: 52% reported humanoid creatures; 85% of those had friendly or neutral experiences
- **Less Human = More Fear**: Those who encountered less humanoid forms (insects, mantis beings) reported more negative experiences, suggesting ontological shock increases with morphological difference
- **The Probability Problem**: Complete evolutionary convergence to humanoid form on another planet speaking our languages, breathing our air, and having compatible DNA is astronomically unlikely

**Gray Alien Features Match Human Evolution**
- **Eyes as Slits**: We're spending more time looking at screens; visual acuity for distance matters less
- **Small Noses and Ears**: Senses essential for hunter-gathering (smell, hearing) matter less in technological civilization
- **Neoteny Effect**: Species' distant descendants often resemble current children—gray aliens are consistently described as childlike, about 3 feet tall
- **Domestication Trajectory**: We're becoming domesticated like dogs from wolves—average male sperm count is 59% of 1973 levels, testosterone dropping 1% yearly since the 1980s

#### **The Intertemporal Breeding Program**

**Ubiquitous Gamete Extraction**
- **Antonio Villas Boas (1957)**: Brazilian farmer describing physical intercourse with a humanoid female
- **Barney Hill**: Reluctantly reported semen samples taken during his famous abduction
- **Jim Penniston (Rendlesham Forest, 1980)**: Told by beings they were from 8,000 years in the future, need genetic material to maintain diversity and avoid extinction
- **The Pattern**: Throughout the 1970s-1990s, nearly every male abductee reported sperm extraction; females had eggs taken or developing fetuses implanted and removed

**The Reproductive Compatibility Argument**
- **Cross-Species Mating**: Antonio Villas Boas had physical intercourse—requires compatible anatomy
- **DNA Compatibility**: You can only create hybrids within the same species or very closely related species
- **The Question**: Would beings from another planet even have DNA? Could you extract viable genetic material?
- **The Answer**: This only makes sense if they're the same species—future humans

**Current Reproductive Crisis**
- 60% reduction in sperm counts in developed world over 40 years
- 50% reduction globally
- Average sperm count now at 47 million per milliliter (below 40 million = conception difficulties)
- Selection for prosocial behaviors (domestication) may have reproductive consequences

#### **Time Machines, Not Spaceships**

**The Fermi Paradox Problem**
- David Grusch: "Why isn't there an overt presence? Why would the government even be allowed to have this stuff in their possession if a higher sentience didn't want it or wanted it back?"
- **The Answer**: They DO want it back—because it's their technology from their own timeline
- Space itself is "remarkably quiet" according to SETI scientists—no electromagnetic superhighway to Earth from space

**The Physics of Disc-Shaped Craft**
- **Form Follows Function**: The classic disc/saucer shape is consistent with manipulating spacetime
- **Frank Tipler's Work (1974)**: Showed a rapidly rotating ring, sphere, or disc can create frame-dragging effects that bend light cones, allowing backwards time travel
- **Earlier Solutions**: Van Stockum, Gödel's universe, all involved rotation of massive objects creating frame-dragging
- **Earth Creates Frame-Dragging**: Even our small planet creates measurable frame-dragging effects
- **Craft Characteristics**: UFOs are consistently reported as rotating and "popping in and out" of spacetime

**Electromagnetic Signatures**
- **Correlation**: Satellite data of electromagnetic/geomagnetic anomalies correlates ridiculously well with significant UFO incidents over 200 years
- **Wormhole Appearance**: A traversible wormhole would appear as a condensed 3D object with volume, not a doorway—and generate massive electromagnetic fallout
- **Skinwalker Ranch**: Famous for electromagnetic activity preceding paranormal events
- **Launch Pads**: High EM and nuclear sites may be the launch/landing pads for time machines, not conventional locations

**Missing Time and Time Anomalies**
- **Corporal Armando (Chile, 1970s)**: Disappeared for 15 minutes from his platoon; 5 days passed for him (evidenced by his watch and beard growth)
- **Travis Walton**: Woke with fully grown beard after shaving before abduction; trees near abduction site facing that direction grew faster
- **Linda Jones (Manchester, UK)**: Running from UFO, grass growing rapidly under her feet
- **Amy Rylance**: Abducted with friend watching; found 790km away but claims 5-7 days passed for her—they traveled in space AND went back in time to minimize the temporal gap

#### **David Grusch's Revelations**

**Exotic Materials Analysis**
- "I talked to people who really did analyze the stuff from the real deal stuff and it's super weird"
- **Heavy Elements**: Europium, californium—elements rarely found together naturally
- **Atomic Arrangements**: "In these atomic arrangements that make like no sense" visible through X-ray diffraction
- **Ceramic-Metal Hull**: "Weird ceramic metal hall structure"
- **Metamaterial Properties**: "We don't understand the emergent metamaterial properties"
- **Current Limitations**: We can image atoms down to 0.2 nanometers (subangstrom) but can't yet configure atoms in the patterns observed

**Government Possession**
- Grusch confirms US government possession of non-human craft
- Some crafts are **gifted**, not just crashed—suggesting cooperation between timelines
- The technology represents a leg up for current humanity's development

#### **Dr. Masters' Personal Contact Experience**

**The Intervention (Phoenix, 2022)**
- **Context**: Dr. Masters was exhausted from travel, thinking about quitting UFO research—but told no one
- **The Approach**: Two individuals approached at a conference; one sat so close "his knee goes into my crotch"
- **The Message**: "I can tell you're very upset about this but I need to be this close for this to work"
- **Instant Relief**: "All of a sudden happiness returns"
- **The Revelation**: "We know you've been thinking about quitting lately and we'd really prefer you didn't do that"
- **How They Knew**: "Once you know who we are, you'll know how we know that"
- Masters telepathically communicated: "Future humans"
- Their response: "So you know how we did that"

**The Information Download**
- **Preparation**: "If I was okay with it, they said we'll black your eyes out and give you three things that will be important at a future time"
- **Trust Built**: By this point Masters realized "in various ways I had been interacting with them the whole time"—the voice in his head when he changed majors, prior conference preparations
- **The Process**: Eyes went black; information flooded his brain
- **Confirmation**: Second individual repeatedly asked "Did you get that?"
- **Access Denied**: Masters agreed to have information placed in his brain but was told he wouldn't have access to it yet
- **Comparison**: "I've talked to people that have experienced it—it was almost like a QR code loaded in their brain"

**The Aftermath**
- Walked through crowded party in trance-like state
- Woman touched his arm: "Are you okay?"
- Slept for 13 hours straight (unusual)
- Woke up crying uncontrollably for hours—not sad, not happy, just processing
- **Second Contact**: Same individual materialized in hallway next day, touched his shoulder, asked if he was okay
- **Key Realization**: "It wasn't negative. I wasn't scared. I just couldn't stop crying—whatever reaction my brain had to being force-fed information"

**The Nature of Contact**
- **Hive Consciousness**: "I wasn't talking to that individual... I was talking to the same day consciousness that knows my thoughts"
- **No Ego**: "There was never a sense of ego or individualism at all"
- **Pronoun Usage**: Only "we" and "they"—never "I" or individualistic pronouns
- **Walking Among Us**: Masters believes they're physically present, disguised or unrecognized: "They absolutely are walking among us"

#### **The Remote Viewing Connection**

**Government Psychic Spying**
- **Project Stargate (1972-1995)**: CIA program to find Russian nuclear bases and American hostages
- **Results**: Multiple cases where psychic intel was confirmed by traditional intelligence methods
- **Alien Contact**: Many remote viewers started picking up imagery and communications from what they considered alien beings

**The Quantum Consciousness Hypothesis**
- **Roger Penrose**: Nobel Prize winner hypothesizing the brain is a room-temperature quantum system
- **Function**: Brain collapses probabilistic quantum reality (Schrödinger's wave equation) into macroscopic discrete classical reality
- **Quantum Computing Parallel**: Quantum computers might be able to send information back in time—access future knowledge states
- **Remote Viewing Explanation**: Super-robust quantum computers (advanced human brains) sending future UFO sightings back to present selves
- **Pre-Memory**: Not remembering the past but accessing future knowledge states

#### **Time Loops and Manifestation**

**Carl Jung's Scarab Beetle**
- **The Story**: Patient dreams of golden scarab beetle being given as gift
- **The Synchronicity**: As she tells Jung, real scarab beetle appears on window
- **The Loop**: Jung gives it to her as gift, opening her to subconscious and "magic"
- **The Mechanism**: If she hadn't told the story, Jung wouldn't have given her the beetle—the telling caused the manifestation
- **UFO Parallel**: Maybe UFO experiences happen in dreamlike states where you "glitch into the future" and this affects life at the margins in ways that cause beautiful things to manifest

**Eric Wargo's Time Loops**
- Remote viewing might be precognition—taking information from future and relaying it to past self
- **Physicist Eric Davis**: "You're wrong about time, you're wrong about space... those dimensions are arbitrary, there's something deeper that creates the illusion of space and time in humans"

#### **The Nature of Reality and Time**

**Beyond Linear Time**
- Our evolution has "pigeonholed us into experiencing time linearly"
- Brains trained to exist in specific environments with linear temporal flow
- **Trans-Temporal Beings**: Not just "future" humans but ascended humans existing in higher dimensions beyond time constraints
- **Hilbert Space**: Quantum mechanical framework suggesting we're living in "compressed classical form"

**The Timeline War**
- **Possible Scenario**: Different future human factions with different timeline objectives
- **Beneficial Timeline**: Advanced civilization trying to communicate, guide consciousness evolution
- **Negative Timeline**: Forces mining human consciousness as natural resource, engineering tribalism and distraction to keep us enslaved
- **Nuclear Concern**: UFO activity around nuclear facilities makes sense if future humans are trying to maintain their ideal timeline and ensure their own existence

**Jacques Vallée's Perspective**
- Books about manipulating time, the fourth and fifth dimensions
- The phenomenon is "trans-temporal in nature"
- **John Keel**: Activity is "prevalent but not prevalent at the same time—like a shadow game showing a little bit but most activity below the noise floor"

#### **Historical Evidence Throughout Human History**

**Ancient Cranial Modification**
- **Ubiquitous Practice**: Intentional cranial deformation found worldwide
- **Binding Techniques**: Cranial wrapping, boarding (Maya stuck children's heads between boards)
- **The Reason (Gibson & Gibson, 1995)**: When asked why, one group said "our ancestors were instructed by the gods to do this—to be more like them"
- **Gray Alien Morphology**: The resulting cranial-facial form is "very reminiscent" of gray alien physiology

**Ancient Accounts**
- UFO sightings "from the beginning of recorded time"
- Mesopotamia, Egypt, through to Roswell
- **Implication**: If time travel is possible in the future, it's always been possible in the past

#### **The Disclosure Strategy**

**What Can Be Released**
- Everything up to current reverse-engineering capabilities
- International cooperation needed (similar to nuclear weapons treaties with Russia, China)
- Set the foundation with hardware/craft information first
- Only then address consciousness and metaphysical aspects
- **Most Important**: Disclose the crimes, the cover-up, the victimization

**Townsend Brown Connection**
- Mid-century inventor working on anti-gravity
- Publicly known for high electrical charges over short distances
- **The Deeper Cut**: He was "super into time travel," discussed it with his daughter Linda
- Confidant "Morgan" eventually revealed: "It's a fucking time machine"
- Past scientists may have already figured out these machines are time machines

**Other Historical Figures Who Knew**
- **Herman Oberth**: Father of German rocketry, said UFOs don't traverse space—they jump between time-space coordinates
- **Navy Commander George Hoover**: Top secret clearance holder who admitted Roswell beings were "just time traveling humans"
- **Steven Spielberg (per Robert Llewellyn)**: In 1993 asked "What's easier to believe—monitored by aliens from another world or monitoring ourselves from the future?"
- Close Encounters hints: WWII pilots exit craft unchanged in age—time travelers

#### **Why This Matters**

**The Stakes**
- Every generation thinks it's living in end times—maybe we're actually on the precipice of massive consciousness revolution
- **Two Paths**: Either we evolve together or we bifurcate and evolve separately in very different timelines
- Technology that makes wars for resources irrelevant
- Ability to mine comets, colonize planets
- Fundamental shift in human consciousness and civilization

**We Are the Point of Contact**
- "Humans tend to report seeing UFOs when they're in certain heightened states of consciousness—maybe that's when they're closest to their future selves"
- **Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel**: God's finger extended to maximum, Adam's slightly contracted—God is always there but decision left to man to reach out
- **The Relationship**: We have same relationship with future selves—it's on us to reach out

#### **Key Quotes**

> "If you think about how we're actually evolving as a species—their eyes are sort of slits, you're going to have more screen time going forward, senses essential for hunter-gathering like smell and hearing matter less than ever."

> "What's easier to believe—that we are being monitored by aliens from another world or that we are monitoring ourselves and studying us from the future?" —Steven Spielberg (1993)

> "Form follows function. The form of these machines seems to indicate the function of manipulating spacetime and traveling forward and backwards."

> "Once you know who we are, you'll know how we know that... Future humans. So you know how we did that." —Future Human to Dr. Masters

> "I wasn't talking to that individual... I was talking to the same day consciousness that knows my thoughts enough to reference two very specific moments."

> "You're wrong about time, you're wrong about space. Those dimensions are arbitrary. There's something deeper that creates the illusion of space and time in humans." —Physicist Eric Davis

> "The sacred knowledge has never been lost, only been covered with myriads of confusion... it is still here."

#### **Conclusion**

Dr. Michael Masters presents the most parsimonious explanation for the UFO phenomenon: These aren't aliens from another planet—they're us from the future. The evidence is overwhelming when you look at it through an evolutionary lens:

**Biological**: Humanoid morphology, reproductive compatibility, evolutionary trajectory matching gray alien features

**Physical**: Disc-shaped craft consistent with time manipulation physics, electromagnetic signatures, missing time experiences

**Behavioral**: Interest in genetic material, concern for nuclear weapons (timeline preservation), increasing contact as we approach technological singularity

**Testimonial**: Consistent reports across cultures and time periods, contactees told explicitly "we are you from the future"

The implications are staggering. We may be unwitting participants in an intertemporal breeding program to ensure our species' survival. The craft we've recovered may be our own future technology. And perhaps most profound: consciousness itself may be a quantum system capable of collapsing probability waves, accessing future knowledge states, and literally manifesting reality through time loops.

As Dr. Masters' experience shows, these beings may already be walking among us, guiding our development with a hive consciousness that transcends individual ego. They reached out to him when he needed it most—not as alien overlords, but as concerned descendants ensuring their ancestors don't give up the fight.

The sacred knowledge was never lost. It was always here. And the decision to reach up—to connect with our higher, future selves—has always been ours to make.
