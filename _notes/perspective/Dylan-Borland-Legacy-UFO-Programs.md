#### **Introduction**
- **Hosts**: Jeremy Corbell & George Knapp
- **Guest**: Dylan Borland, former intelligence analyst who worked for BAE Systems on classified multi-agency programs, witnessed a large triangular UAP over Langley Air Force Base, and suffered severe reprisals after attempting to blow the whistle

#### **The Langley Air Force Base Sighting**
- **The Craft**: Large triangular UAP making 90-degree turns over a highly sensitive military installation
- **Distinctive Feature**: "Gold, lava, plasma" electrostatic discharge covering the craft—described as a yellow semi-transparent flow pulsating across the entire surface, like watching a lava lamp overlay
- **Technology Assessment**: Far beyond acknowledged human capabilities; no known propulsion system matches what Dylan witnessed
- **Implications**: Either non-human intelligence technology or evidence of a breakaway civilization with capabilities not disclosed even to Congress

#### **Exposure to Legacy Program Information**
- **The Setting**: Working 12-hour shifts at BAE Systems on classified networks with access to multiple agency programs
- **The Connection**: Coworkers who had been involved in legacy UAP programs, whose careers had also been destroyed, assumed Dylan was "read into" the program
- **Information Shared**: Details about:
  - Reverse-engineered craft and technology integration
  - Biological entities ("biologics")
  - Specific program names and locations
  - How legacy programs operate and are hidden
- **The Agreement**: If these individuals died, Dylan would "blow the whole thing up" and release what they told him
- **Surveillance**: Dylan received a popup message on his classified computer warning him not to discuss UAP topics—someone was actively monitoring conversations

#### **The Systematic Destruction Campaign**
**Clearance Manipulation (The Primary Weapon)**
- Dylan's security clearance was placed in "purgatory"—existing but inaccessible, preventing him from working elsewhere
- Worked 16-hour shifts, weekends and holidays for $62,000/year in Northern Virginia (one of the most expensive regions in America)
- Multiple companies tried to hire him and filed complaints when they discovered his clearance was being improperly housed
- For 3.5 years, unable to take another job while being systematically ground down

**The Brake Line Incident**
- May 2018: After finally getting his clearance restored and giving two weeks' notice, Dylan's clearance was immediately erased again
- That night, his car totaled—police investigation revealed brake lines were cut
- Lead investigator came to Dylan's home and warned him: "The only reason I'm not charging you with a crime is because your brake lines were cut"
- Officer's assessment: They wanted it to look like suicide
- **Critical Problem**: Dylan has been unable to locate the official police report stating the brake lines were cut, though he has the accident report

**VA Psychological Warfare**
- After witnessing a suicide, the VA accused Dylan of faking the police report and lying about being a police officer
- Medical records officially state he is "prone to delusions" and "makes everything up"
- **Biofeedback/Hypnosis Program**: Dylan was subjected to weekly sessions where he was:
  - Hooked up to a polygraph machine
  - Shown violent images (Afghan child with gun) alternating with peaceful images (butterfly)
  - Forced to count backwards from 100 by 7
  - Screamed at and subjected to air horn blasts if he made a mistake
  - Had to restart the entire process
- **MK-Ultra Connection**: Dylan believes this was a continuation of CIA psychological experimentation programs
- **Medication Attempt**: Put on PTSD/depression medication that caused him to wake up with a physical compulsion to commit suicide
  - When he reported this, the VA psychologist (a CIA employee) told him to "increase your dose"
  - A psychiatrist who discovered a "team dedicated to Dylan" at the VA filed a complaint, was told nothing would change, and resigned in protest
  - This doctor told Dylan: "You need to do everything in your power to live through this. What they are doing to you is wrong."

**Financial Destruction**
- Had to pull his 401(k) to keep his house
- Fought for unemployment ($270/week in Northern Virginia—insufficient for groceries)
- Nearly became homeless
- Reached a point where he "began to consider non-violent offenses to have three hots and a cot"
- Lost everything except his house over three years

**Navy Out-Processing Anomaly**
- During medical discharge from the Air Force (2013), was required to out-process through the Navy (unusual)
- Navy doctors asked bizarre questions: "Do you believe in God? Do you believe in ESP? Remote viewing? Aliens?"
- Same questioning pattern repeated years later during VA PTSD evaluation
- Suggests Dylan was flagged in some database related to UAP/consciousness research

#### **The Whistleblower Process—And Its Failure**

**Congressional Testimony (March 2023)**
- Met with Senate Intelligence Committee staffers in a SCIF
- Testified about the Langley sighting and legacy program details including:
  - Specific program names (a two-word program name that made one staffer's "mouth hit the floor")
  - Technology integration and how it works
  - Locations of legacy programs
  - Serious crimes including corruption, sexual harassment, misuse of taxpayer funds
- **Senate Reaction**: Debated whether to bring Dylan to the House side due to "safety concerns" for him
- Eventually testified to House Intelligence Committee staffer who "took safety seriously"
- Was told: "Is it what the country needs?" "Yes." "Do I go into everything and am I protected?" "Yes."

**ARROW (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office)**
- Testified to ARROW (March 27-28, 2023) with a DoD officer and FBI agent
- Provided detailed information connecting current events to legacy programs and technologies
- **The Trap**: ARROW classified Dylan's testimony and created a Memorandum for Record (MFR)
- The MFR was sent to Dylan's government email address where he had to print it in front of his entire office
- Dylan discovered the MFR was "fishing expedition" targeting a specific Congressional staffer
- Had to make corrections to protect information he didn't want shared
- Signed the MFR on the day Trump was indicted in Georgia and the Gang of Eight was called into an emergency meeting

**ICIG (Intelligence Community Inspector General)**
- Testified to ICIG in late summer/early fall 2023
- **The Worst Experience**: Dylan felt this was purely a "fishing expedition"
- Questions designed to determine how much Dylan actually knew and how dangerous he was to legacy programs
- During questioning, a government employee cut off someone asking a question and told Dylan: "You don't answer that question"
- When asked what he wanted out of the process, Dylan said: "I want to look Congress in the eyes, tell them the truth under oath, so when I die, I can answer for this and know I did my job"
- **ICIG Response**: "As far as we're concerned, you already did that and you're not doing it again"
- At the end: "You are credible, not urgent. Go disappear in the winds. Leave this all behind. Shut up."
- Told that everything he discussed—including his childhood and unclassified information—was now "subject to executive review"
- **Result**: Dylan was completely shut out for over a year and a half

**The Polygraph Retaliation**
- October 2024: During a CI (counterintelligence) polygraph for a new agency position
- Polygrapher asked about his ICIG complaint (which should be confidential)
- Polygrapher left, came back laughing, named the IG, and demanded: "What was the nature of your complaint? What are the details?"
- Dylan: "You can't ask me that. You don't have need to know."
- **Result**: Dylan didn't pass the polygraph (didn't fail, but didn't pass)

**Surveillance and Intimidation**
- Dylan has assumed for years that phones are tapped, computers monitored, physical surveillance
- During meetings with Corbell and Knapp, all three witnessed obvious surveillance
- Online forums Dylan participated in (like "R Space" on classified networks) were infiltrated
- Statements made in classified chat rooms appeared verbatim on Twitter within 24-48 hours
- Direct evidence of intelligence community manipulation of public perception on social media

#### **The Bigger Picture: What Dylan Believes**

**About the Phenomenon**
- "I think what we are dealing with is very, very, very old"
- Not necessarily extraterrestrials in the strict definition (beings from another planet)
- More likely what ancient humans called "gods, demons, angels, jinn"—interdimensional or co-existing intelligences
- Multiple species/factions with different agendas
- "They have been here for most of recorded human history"
- Physical craft exist, but may not need them: "I don't think they need craft to get here. That's some kind of bobble to get us interested"
- May have influence over human consciousness and decision-making
- **Resource Question**: "I have a strong belief that they have an interest in certain families"

**About ARROW's Statements**
- ARROW's claim that "there is no scientific evidence of extraterrestrials" is technically true
- You need a control group to have scientific proof
- "Extraterrestrial" has an exact definition: entity from another planet
- These phenomena may not fit that narrow definition

**About Disclosure Strategy**
- "I provided three rudimentary drawings, one of which was unclassified and the other two were immediately thrown into a SAP"
- "The two that were thrown into a SAP prove we are not alone"
- Believes everything up to current reverse-engineering capabilities should be disclosed
- International cooperation needed (similar to nuclear weapons treaties)
- Foundation must be set before discussing consciousness/metaphysical aspects
- **The Crimes Must Be Disclosed First**: The reprisals, the cover-up, the victimization of whistleblowers

**Why People Have Committed Suicide**
- Dylan confirms 100% that people have committed real suicides (not fake ones) over this issue
- The isolation, loss of career, financial devastation, and being unable to talk about what you know
- Being 30-something years old, completely alone, with everything you worked for gone, no retirement, driving a broken car held together with zip ties

#### **Dylan's Warning and Call to Action**

**To the Intelligence Community**
- "The time is now where you must choose whether you honor your oath or your orders"
- "If you have courage, you already know the answer"
- The standard operating procedures (SOPs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to silence whistleblowers need to adapt—too many people have come forward now

**To Other Whistleblowers**
- "I'm so sorry to them. This is a joke. I'm sorry for everybody who has tried to do the right thing"
- "I'm sorry for all the people that sit at home and they have no one to talk to. They're isolated. They're lonely"
- "I hope we are all able to find peace and I hope that you can make your way to people that will help you get your story out"

**To the Public**
- "If people want disclosure, it's now up to you"
- "This lame duck approach of we are going to make promises and we are going to go back on them... everybody's going to have to answer for it at the end"
- His testimony would "dramatically change not just America but humanity instantly"
- Talking about technology that makes wars for resources irrelevant
- "Economics, migration, travel, mining comets, going to other planets"

**To Congress**
- "Congress knows. Everybody can play the games... Y'all know"
- Need to establish protections for whistleblowers—financial support, legal protections, safe landing spots
- Without protections, people with information remain scared to come forward

#### **Key Quotes**

> "I witnessed a triangle at Langley Air Force Base but I have direct in-depth knowledge of a hell of a lot more and I am not comfortable sharing that over the phone."

> "They wanted it to look like a suicide, which goes into what the VA was doing with me and the medical issues and the doctors."

> "Everything I talked about in that room is now up for executive review... Dylan, every single thing you talked about is now subject to executive review. Do not go outside of those bounds your whole life."

> "What I have provided is true. People have been victimized. People have committed suicide over this... And more importantly, because I know what I testify to dramatically changes not just America but humanity instantly."

> "I provided three rudimentary drawings, one of which was unclassified and the other two were immediately thrown into a SAP. And the two that were thrown into a SAP prove we are not alone."

> "I think that it's quite clear that we have been influenced by something else... These things, whatever they are, are probably what are referred to as gods or demons or angels or jinn."

> "You serve your country. Your country has done this. The truth is the truth and the truth speaks for itself and the truth is a light."

#### **Current Status**
- Dylan's entire government career is over—he will never work in the intelligence community again
- Has saved enough to pay his mortgage for a while, then will likely pull his 401(k) again (no retirement)
- Married one month before becoming a whistleblower—his entire marriage has been consumed by this ordeal
- Plans to finally go on his honeymoon and "disappear for a while"
- Hopes that veterans, the special forces community, and average Americans will demand accountability
- Willing to testify under oath to Congress if given the opportunity

#### **Conclusion**

Dylan Borland represents the cost of trying to do the right thing in a system designed to crush dissent. A decorated analyst with a master's degree and 15 years of experience, he witnessed technology that shouldn't exist, gained knowledge of programs that officially don't exist, and was systematically destroyed for attempting to report it through legal channels.

His testimony reveals that the whistleblower process itself may be weaponized—not to facilitate disclosure, but to identify, classify, and neutralize those who know too much. Congressional testimony is welcomed, then ignored. ARROW appears more interested in protecting programs than investigating them. The ICIG, which should be the ultimate safeguard, may function as a "fishing expedition" to determine how dangerous a whistleblower is to the establishment.

Dylan's story is a warning: The system is not designed to protect you. There are no real protections for UAP whistleblowers, despite promises. And the phenomena at the heart of this cover-up may be far stranger than simple extraterrestrial visitation—ancient, influential, and deeply intertwined with human history and consciousness.

As Dylan stated: "If people want disclosure, it's now up to you."
