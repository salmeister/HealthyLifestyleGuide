## Overview

**🎧 Podcast**: [The School of Greatness](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMG5w22POeeykqONbfGi00m4AqxhnzmWc) | **👨‍🔬 Expert**: [Billy Carson](https://www.4biddenknowledge.com/)  
**🎯 Topic**: Manifesting Reality Through Ancient Wisdom and Modern Science  
**⏱️ Key Takeaway**: Consciousness and intention are powerful forces that can shape reality when aligned with universal principles

#### **Introduction**
- **Host**: Lewis Howes
- **Guest**: Billy Carson, founder of Forbidden Knowledge and author of bestsellers like *Fractal Holographic Universe*, dives into manifestation, consciousness, and the universe’s hidden mechanics.

#### **The Universe as a Holographic Matrix**
- **Core Concept**: Carson views the universe as a fractal holographic matrix of light—everything, even solids like tables, is slowed-down light frequencies. We perceive less than 1% of the spectrum, living in a sliver of reality.
- **Quantum Insight**: The double-slit experiment shows particles collapse from waves into matter via observation, suggesting reality is a wave of potentials shaped by consciousness.

#### **Dimensions and Human Perception**
- **11 Dimensions**: Theoretical physicists propose 11 stacked dimensions, separated by frequency. Higher dimensions (e.g., 4D tesseracts) allow past, present, and future to coexist—think *Interstellar*’s tesseract scene.
- **Transcendence**: Ancient texts (e.g., Emerald Tablets) and modern brain research (synapses vanishing into other dimensions) hint humans can access higher realms through consciousness.

#### **Manifestation Formula: CT × A = M**
- **Conscious Thought × Action = Manifestation**: Carson’s formula, inspired by ancient Anunnaki “ordainers of destiny” and his childhood hustle selling toys for ice cream money, stresses specificity and action.
- **Inner Work First**: Trauma blocks manifestation—you need space. Forgiveness and shadow work clear it, aligning body and mind via water’s response to words (e.g., Emoto’s experiments).

#### **Key Insights**
- **Words Shape Reality**: Negative self-talk (e.g., “I suck”) collapses potential outcomes, while affirmations rewrite DNA—science backs 21 days of positivity altering genetic expression.
- **Time’s Illusion**: We’re 7 seconds behind “real time,” per brain experiments. Elite performers (e.g., Michael Jordan) surf closer to the wave, leveraging belief over doubt.
- **Collaboration Over Competition**: Ego-driven dominance, coded in epigenetic trauma, traps us in cycles of conflict. Collaboration aligns with universal abundance.

#### **Practical Applications**
- **Forgive Yourself**: Start by releasing past guilt—Carson’s near-death experience taught him gratitude heals faster than suppression.
- **Visualize Vividly**: Meditate as if you already have your goal (e.g., driving your dream car), then seize opportunities the universe offers.
- **Shift Energy**: Snap a rubber band on your wrist to catch negative thoughts, or recall a joyful memory to raise frequency—emotions dictate energy, energy dictates life.

#### **Broader Implications**
- **Ancient Cycles**: Texts like the Sumerian tablets and Indian Vedas describe wars of “gods” and golden ages. We’re in a silver age, awakening to break the cycle of collapse.
- **Money as Energy**: It’s not the goal—find your passion, meet a need, and money follows as a side effect (e.g., Carson’s dot-com success).
- **Consciousness Streams**: The brain downloads non-local consciousness, sending experiences back to the universe—dreams may glimpse higher dimensions.

#### **Conclusion**
- **Self-Power**: Carson’s shift from survival mode (selling toys at 8) to architecting his life (multimillion-dollar ventures) proves greatness lies in recognizing your own power.

This episode fuses cosmic theory with actionable steps, urging listeners to heal, believe, and co-create with the universe’s flow.
