## [The Colorado Experiment with Dr. Ben Bocchicchio](https://youtu.be/P4hq8sIvb3c?si=UDeE7TohFACTllJF)

**Podcast**: [Fitness Confidential Podcast](https://vinnietortorich.com/) | **Guest**: Dr. Ben Bocchicchio

#### **Introduction**
- **Host**: Vinnie Tortorich
- **Guest**: Ben Bocchicchio, a veteran in exercise physiology with a focus on Nautilus equipment and high-intensity training.

#### **Nautilus Machines**

- **Historical Context**: 
  - Arthur Jones created Nautilus machines to match the human body's strength curve, using isometric tests to design cams for each muscle group.
  - Machines were revolutionary for isolating muscle movements and providing resistance throughout the entire range of motion, unlike traditional weights.

- **Precision and Impact**: 
  - The precision of Nautilus machines was highlighted, particularly how they could fatigue muscles effectively without heavy weights due to the cam design.
  - Specific machines like the shoulder shrug and pullover were discussed for their unique, effective muscle targeting.

#### **Training Philosophy**

- **High-Intensity, Low-Volume**: 
  - Emphasis on one set to failure with slow, controlled movements to maximize muscle recruitment without causing damage.
  - Bocchicchio's philosophy evolved from Jones' methods, advocating for minimal sets (one or two) to stimulate muscle growth efficiently.

- **Slow Resistance Training**: 
  - Originated from wanting to leverage the Nautilus cam's design by moving weights at a pace close to zero speed to maintain constant muscle tension.

- **Muscle Recruitment**: 
  - Discusses the importance of recruiting fast-twitch muscle fibers for growth, which are best stimulated through intense, short-duration exercises.

#### **Exercise Routine**

- **Workout Structure**: 
  - **Big to Small**: Focus on larger muscle groups first, like legs (quads, hamstrings), then upper body (lats, shoulders, pecs, arms).
  - **Pre-Fatigue Technique**: Before compound movements like leg press or bench press, isolate the primary muscle to ensure it's the limiting factor, not the secondary muscles.

- **Example Exercises**: 
  - Leg extensions, leg curls, lat pulldowns/pull-overs, lateral raises, pec flies, curls, tricep extensions.

#### **Muscle and Health Considerations**

- **Sarcopenia**: 
  - Training to combat age-related muscle loss by ensuring protein synthesis through targeted, high-intensity workouts.

- **Supplementation**: 
  - Creatine for cognitive and muscle benefits, collagen with vitamin C for joint health, but generally advises against over-reliance on supplements.

#### **Philosophical Insights**

- **Exercise Efficiency**: 
  - Advocates for workouts that are short but intensely effective, challenging the notion of long-duration or high-volume training.

- **Against Anabolics**: 
  - Criticizes the use of steroids and other performance-enhancers, highlighting the health risks and inefficiencies for natural muscle building.

#### **Closing Thoughts**

- **Contact Information**: Dr. Ben Bocchicchio can be found online or through his website for further inquiries.
- **Support**: Encouragement to support Vinnie's podcast through his website for continued access to free content.

This episode dives deep into the legacy of Nautilus equipment, the science behind high-intensity training, and how these principles can be applied for health and muscle maintenance across different ages.
